                <h2>For people in the Middle Ages, wine and beer were not luxuries but necessities. </h2>
                <p>
                    Water supplied in towns was impure and often dangerous. The antiseptic role played by wine made it a part of the rudimentary medicine of the era. Mixed with wine, water became drinkable, if not palatable. Water was rarely consumed on its own , at least in cities. <span style="font-style: italic;">“Water is not wholesome, sole by its self, for an Englishman.”</span> Wrote by Andrew Borde, in 1542.

                <h2>Using cork as a stopper was rediscovered during the 17th century.</h2>
                <p>
                    Cork was used by the Ancient Greeks and Romans to seal amphorae. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the practice was abandoned and unknown in the Middle Ages. It reappeared with Dom Pérignon, around 1680, who discovered it in the bottles carried by Spanish pilgrims visiting the abbey of Hautvillers. At the time, he was using wooden pegs covered by hemp, flax, or rags, all lubricated with tallow or soaked with oil, so he immediately saw the value of these flexible corks.

                <h2>Champagne was the direct result of the union of bottle and cork.</h2>
                <p>
                    Regional wine production had stagnated during the 16th century. Effervescence was a problem when the Champagne was transported long distances. It caused explosions within the barrels, the only form of container authorized by royal regulations. The bottle (which the English were first to use for the transportation of wine) and Portuguese cork came together to solve this problem. Dom Pérignon provided Champagne’s other stroke of good fortune. The Benedictine monk, cellar man at the Abbey of Hautvilliers, rediscovered cork’s excellent properties for sealing bottles at the same time as perfecting the art of blending. The cork stopper was born, and its use continues to the present day.

                <h2>There are no fewer than 40,000 different names given to grapes varieties around the world. </h2>
                <p>
                    However, many of these refer to the same variety, the name vary according to the country and even from one region to another. Taking in account different synonyms and translations, the varieties cultivated across the planet number about 5,000. Experts are still a long way from achieving a truly accurate number.

                <h2>A competition medal is not always a guarantee of quality. </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some very serious competitions, both at an international level (Brussels International Wine Competition, Vinalies International in Paris, San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition) and at a regional level (Crus Bourgeois of Médoc Cup, Saint Bacchus Selection for the wines of Roussillon, etc.) However, there is a lack of rigor in some of the competitions, especially the regional events. In addition, there is no guarantee that when a medal is awarded to a winery, it will appear only on the label of the particular wine that won at the tasting.

                <h2>The color of a red wine is a clue to its identity.</h2>
                <p>
                    It can range from very light ruby to deepest garnet. A wine with an intense, dark appearance (or color) shows concentration. On the other hand, a paler wine suggests a lighter, less tannic palate. By simple visual observation, the taster can already get an idea of the wine’s personality and even, sometimes, deduce its origin. For example, if you know it’s French, a deep garnet color may indicate that the wine comes from Bordeaux or the south of France, rather than Beaujolais or Burgundy.

                <h2>The first wine style in history was rosé.</h2>
                <p>
                    It was not until the end of the 17th century that wine took on a truly red color, when winemakers discovered that macerating colored grape skins in must (grape juice and pulp) gave the wine color. There is a reminder of this evolution in a word that the British wine industry still uses for Bordeaux: <span style="font-style: italic;">“claret.”</span>. It derived from clairet, a dark rosé exported from Bordeaux until the end of the 18th century.

                <h2>A strong, characterful wine is necessary to accompany a powerfully flavoured dish. </h2>
                <p>
                    If you match a delicate dish with a really powerful wine, you risk killing the flavours of the food with those of the wine. For instance, a fish mousse should be accompanied by a dry, light wine, with good acidity, such as Muscadet or Sancerre; and a fish in sauce is best paired with a supple wine with subtle aromas, such as a Savennières or white Pessac-Léognan; while fish meunière sauce (brown butter) calls for an Alsace Riesling or a Mâcon Lugny; finally, Bouzy is a good choice for a ris de veau (veal sweetbreads).
